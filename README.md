### Fresh installation of Tensorflow in local machine

When installing TensorFlow, we want to make sure we are installing and upgrading to the newest version available in PyPi.

Therefore, weâ€™ll be using the following command syntax with pip:

`pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow`

It will install around 516MB of packages and then check the version like below in a .py file

```py
import tensorflow as tf
print(tf.__version__)
```

Will output `2.2.0`

**To verify the installation, you can also run the following command within the terminal directly, which will print the TensorFlow version:**

`python -c 'import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.__version__)'`
