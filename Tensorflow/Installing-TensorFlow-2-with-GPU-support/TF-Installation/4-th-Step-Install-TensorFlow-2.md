#### Followed the below steps while being in the (base) environment in the Terminal - 4-Dec-2020

https://tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html - This official link suggest activating a new conda environment and installing TF with the **pip** command below

`pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade tensorflow==2.2.0` - But I did not have to

**Before you can install and run TensorFlow, you'll need to install the CUDA drivers for your machine and the cuDNN updates for it.**

### Fresh installation of Tensorflow in local machine

When installing TensorFlow, we want to make sure we are installing and upgrading to the newest version available in PyPi.

Therefore, weâ€™ll be using the following command syntax with pip:

```
pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow

```

It will install around 516MB of packages and then check the version like below in a .py file

```py
import tensorflow as tf
print(tf.__version__)
```

Will output `2.2.0`

**To verify the installation, you can also run the following command within the terminal directly, which will print the TensorFlow version:**

```
python -c 'import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.__version__)'

```

### Extra notes on Installation

1. https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip#2.-create-a-virtual-environment-recommended - This official guide clearly says - While the TensorFlow provided pip package is recommended, a community-supported Anaconda package is available. To install, read the [Anaconda TensorFlow guide](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/tasks/tensorflow/).

But the above **Anaconda TensorFlow guide** recommends to create a new conda environment and install TF there.

To install the current release of GPU TensorFlow on Linux or Windows:

```
conda create -n tf-gpu tensorflow-gpu
conda activate tf-gpu
```
