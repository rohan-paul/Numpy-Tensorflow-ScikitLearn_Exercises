#### NUMPY SUM

Let’s take a look at how NumPy axes work inside of the NumPy sum function.

When trying to understand axes in NumPy sum, you need to know what the axis parameter actually controls.

#### In `np.sum()`, the axis parameter controls which axis will be aggregated.

Said differently, the axis parameter controls which axis will be collapsed.

Remember, functions like **sum(), mean(), min(), median()**, and other statistical functions aggregate your data.

### NUMPY SUM WITH AXIS = 0

Here, we’re going to use the NumPy sum function with axis = 0.

First, we’re just going to create a simple NumPy array.

```python
np_array_2d = np.arange(0, 6).reshape([2,3])

```

Lets print to see the whole matrix

```python
print(np_array_2d)
[[0 1 2]
 [3 4 5]]

```

`np_array_2d`, is a 2-dimensional array that contains the values from 0 to 5 in a 2-by-3 format.

Next, let’s use the NumPy sum function with axis = 0.

```python
np.sum(np_array_2d, axis = 0)

```

And here’s the output.

```python
array([3, 5, 7])
```

#### When we set axis = 0, the function actually sums down the columns.

Why? Doesn’t axis 0 refer to the rows?

This confuses many beginners, so let me explain.

### Because, the axis parameter indicates which axis gets collapsed.

### Remember that axis 0 refers to the vertical direction across the rows. That means that the code np.sum(np_array_2d, axis = 0) collapses the rows during the summation.

## So when we set axis = 0, we’re not summing across the rows. Rather we collapse axis 0.

## NUMPY SUM WITH AXIS = 1

Again start with our earlier same array `np_array_2d`

```python
print(np_array_2d)
[[0 1 2]
 [3 4 5]]

```

we’re going to use the sum function, and we’ll set the axis parameter to axis = 1.

```python
np.sum(np_array_2d, axis = 1)

```

And here’s the output:

```
array([3, 12])

```

#### So Generally

If you do `.sum(axis=n)`, for example, then dimension `n` is collapsed and deleted, with each value in the new matrix equal to the sum of the corresponding collapsed values. For example, if `b` has shape `(5,6,7,8)`, and you do `c = b.sum(axis=2)`, then axis 2 (dimension with size 7) is collapsed, and the result has shape `(5,6,8)`. Furthermore, `c[x,y,z]` is equal to the sum of all elements `b[x,y,:,z]`.

### axis 1 refers to the horizontal direction across the columns. That means that the code np.sum(np_array_2d, axis = 1) collapses the columns during the summation.
